# Contributing.md

You are welcome to contribute to this project if you know enough about browser extension development and are willing to follow the following rules:

> * No tracking code allowed - Do not write anything on this project that involves tracking, even on browsers that already track users, such as Google Chrome

> * Do not modify snapshot files - Snapshot files act as an archived old version of files. They should not be modified or removed at all. Snapshot files have a V1, V2, etc. before the extension.

> * Create a snapshot of your work for backup - When you finish editing a file, make a backup copy with V1, V2, etc. at the end of the name before the extension.

> * Do not modify README.md files - Please do not modify README.md files, I have them under control. If you want to see a change, request it under the issues tab with the label "Enhancement"

> * Do not bloat the extension - I want this extension to remain light, so that it doesn't interfere with the users browser session. Please keep the memory usage (RAM and CPU) under 1 megabyte at all times.

> * Do not modify the license - Obviously the license should not be modified. Don't edit it at all

> * Do not modify the contributing.md file - I have to have control of this. To correct issues, request it under the issues tab with the label "Enhancement"

> * Do not add in new languages - Without permission, please do not use any other languages for this project. The current allowed languages are XUL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML5.

Please abide by these rules to develop the GitHubby extension.

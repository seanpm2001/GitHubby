Translations in languages other than English are machine translated and are not yet accurate. No errors have been fixed yet as of March 21st 2021. Please report translation errors [here](https://github.com/seanpm2001/GitHubby/issues/). Make sure to backup your correction with sources and guide me, as I don't know languages other than English well (I plan on getting a translator eventually) please cite [wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) and other sources in your report. Failing to do so will result in a rejection of the correction being published.

Note: due to limitations with GitHub's interpretation of markdown (and pretty much every other web-based interpretation of markdown) clicking these links will redirect you to a separate file on a separate page that isn't the intended page. You will be redirected to the [.github folder](/.github/) of this project, where the README translations are hosted.

Translations are currently done with Bing translate and DeepL. Support for Google Translate translations is coming to a close due to privacy concerns.

# GitHubby
GitHubby is a browser extension that improves the experience of GitHub by setting limits by GitHub and making improvements. This is my first browser extension, so please correct any issues and give an ELI5 or ELI13 description, I have never done this before.

***

## About

See above. This project is for the development of GitHubby, part of [Project 1001](https://github.com/Project1k1/) aimed to help users get past truncation limits on GitHub. It is a browser extension project that is far from complete, and needs community support.

***

## History

_This project has a short history so far._

This project was started on July 22nd 2020 as a first step into browser extension development, and also to fix a user-end GitHub truncation issue at 1000 entries/files. Its development has waned multiple times.

On July 20th 2021, the project was updated, and a new website for the project was created via GitHub pages. The README.md file was subsequently modernized on July 21st 2021 (the next day)

***

## Platforms

GitHubby is going to have primary support for Firefox, but will also have support for 6 other browsers (at the moment, 7 browsers total) including:

1. Firefox (primary)

2. Google Chrome (lowest priority)

3. Opera

4. Safari

5. Microsoft Edge

6. Konquerer

7. GNU IceCat

***

## Purpose

GitHubby is a tool for browsers that improves the GitHub experience by giving warnings of large file upload errors, file upload limit errors, truncation warnings, and possibly more.

It is a tool that improves the GitHub experience.

## Software status

All of my works are free some restrictions. DRM (**D**igital **R**estrictions **M**anagement) is not present in any of my works.

![DRM-free_label.en.svg](DRM-free_label.en.svg)

This sticker is supported by the Free Software Foundation. I never intend to include DRM in my works.

I am using the abbreviation "Digital Restrictions Management" instead of the more known "Digital Rights Management" as the common way of addressing it is false, there are no rights with DRM. The spelling "Digital Restrictions Management" is more accurate, and is supported by [Richard M. Stallman (RMS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman/) and the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation/)

This section is used to raise awareness for the problems with DRM, and also to protest it. DRM is defective by design and is a major threat to all computer users and software freedom.
